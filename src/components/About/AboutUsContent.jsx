        The Restbeef Steakhouse was established in 1989 in Chicago. We started as a small stall in the middle of Chicago City. Our first experience was based on traditional recipes that our founder, George Freeman, received from his grandmother. Those recipes were passed down through generations. What seemed like a simple thing—making fresh meat—became a profitable business. Over time, George expanded his stall to a small café where hot steaks were served. The news about the café, which served excellent steaks, spread throughout Chicago. People who wanted to try fresh beef were lined up. Then George realized that he had outgrown his café and it was time to expand. It was then that the Restbeef trademark was registered, and the small café turned into a chic meat restaurant. At the same time, our Chef Renzo Rogers joined us and gathered a team of specialists who delight the people of Chicago every day with wonderful dishes.
